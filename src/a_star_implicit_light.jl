# A* shortest-path search with two generalizations over a_star_spath:
# 1. The graph is implicit; edges are not explicitly stored but instead generated
# during vertex expansion by a user-defined visitor function
# 2. The include_vertex! visitor function can also ADD new vertices, i.e. the size
# of the graph can increase during the search
#
# We do not bother with deleting vertices as it is typically not worth the effort
# for implicit search
